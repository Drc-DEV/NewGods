The New Gods Server Plugin for Minecraft


> **Disclaimer**: New Gods was originally created by discord user **Liam (Kouvo)#4021**
> They have not been seen active in over a year and due to community desire for continued plugin updates I have started releasing versions built off of Liam's code. I do not claim any of their work as my own. 
> The plugin will remain free with the code publicly available just as before. The goal is to simply keep the plugin working for the latest version of Minecraft and to work on Liam's Todo List which was included in the project files he posted.

## Download and Install
To download the plugin head over the the Github releases box on the right and select the version which best suits you. If you do not know then you can ask in the community Discord linked below. From the release, select the NewGods jar file and download it. 

Once the plugin is downloaded, drop it into your server's plugins folder and restart your server. New Gods supports reloading but restarting your server completely is always cleaner. After the restart the plugin will have generated a folder with a config file inside. You can use this to adjust the plugin's options to your liking. Details on the config file can be found on the plugin's Spigot page (also linked below)
